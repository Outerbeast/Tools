# Tools
Various helper scripts and apps for Sven Co-op mapping

- LazyRipent - launcher script for [lazyripent](https://github.com/Zode/Lazyripent2) by Zode
- Ripent - launcher script for ripent.exe (I don't recommend, use lazyripent instead)
- MOTDGen - generates a motd file for a map series
- ReRAD - cmd tool for RAD.exe, useful for redoing the RAD process for compiled bsps

Usage instructions are included with script file headers.

Note: for launching the PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`), you have to make sure that you have allowed execution of PowerShell scripts, otherwise the scripts will fail to launch.
